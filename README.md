# Early Wearables Kit (2015) 

![Early Wearables Kit](earlyWearablesKit.jpg)

This repository is an "Early Wearables Kit" made by the Maker Lab in the Humanities (MLab) at the University of Victoria (http://maker.uvic.ca/). The Wearables Kit prompts people to reverse engineer and reassemble an electro-mobile skull stick-pin intended for cravats, designed by Gustave Trouvé, built by Auguste-Germain Cadet-Picard, and exhibited at the *Exposition universelle* in Paris in 1867. Powered by a 1.5-volt zinc-carbon battery in the wearer's pocket, the skull was said to snap its jaws and move its eyes. To activate the battery, the wearer would flip the pocket battery from a vertical to a horizontal position. Once activated, the battery would trigger a mechanism (resembling that of an electric bell) hidden inside the small skull. This combination of electricity with jewellery was not only unique for the 1860s. It also positions the stick-pin as an early wearable technology. 

To our knowledge, only one instance of this stick-pin exists in a memory institution today, at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London (see http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O115814/stick-pin-cadet-picard-auguste/). However, it cannot be accessed, and it is not accompanied by the original battery.

After significant research, including archival work and rapid prototyping experiments, the MLab wonders if the skull was ever fully automated or functioned consistently before or after the 1867 exposition. So we submit this repository to you for some conjectural history and manufacturing. 

The Early Wearables Kit includes 3-D models for the skull stick-pin, historical images for contextualizing it, a guide for interpreting it, instructions (starring Trouvé himself) for ways it may be assembled, and a box for storing, arranging, and circulating the Kit's components in tactile form. We have also included references for additional reading, photographs of the Kit as it's been exhibited, and abstracts for academic essays published by the MLab about the Kit.   

The Wearables Kit is part of a series of kits by the Maker Lab, and it was made with support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund (BCKDF).

KITS FOR CULTURAL HISTORY

JENTERY SAYERS AND THE MAKER LAB IN THE HUMANITIES (MLAB)

University of Victoria

A project at the University of Victoria's Maker Lab in the Humanities, the Kits for Cultural History ("Kits") are small boxes of inexpensive materials assembled for media history. Each Kit is composed of a box, prototype, model, and supplement. This kit for Hyperrhiz articulates a rationale for the Kits, provides a recipe for them, and shares example material from them.

Jentery Sayers is Assistant Professor of English, member of the Cultural, Social, and Political Thought program, and Director of the Maker Lab in the Humanities at the University of Victoria. He is currently working on four book projects: The Digging Condition (a cultural history of early magnetic recording with University of Michigan Press), the Routledge Companion to Media Studies and Digital Humanities (ed., with Routledge), Making Humanities Matter (ed., part of the Debates in the Digital Humanities series with University of Minnesota Press), and Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities (co-ed., with Rebecca Frost Davis, Matthew K. Gold, Katherine D. Harris, for the Modern Language Association).

The Maker Lab in the Humanities at the University of Victoria conducts comparative media research across digital fabrication and physical computing techniques to expand scholarly communication through hybrid forms. Since 2013, the Lab's primary research area has been the Kits for Cultural History project, to which Nina Belojevic, Tiffany Chan, Nicole Clouston, Laura Dosky, Devon Elliott, Katherine Goertz, Jonathan O. Johnson, Shaun Macpherson, Kaitlynn McQueston, Danielle Morgan, Victoria Murawski, Jentery Sayers, William J. Turkel, and Zaqir Virani have contributed.

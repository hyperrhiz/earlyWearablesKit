<h3 style="clear:left;"><img src="/assets/img/elegant_font/images/png/icon_documents.png" style="padding-right:20px;float:left;">Kits for Cultural History, or Fluxkits for Scholarly Communication</h3>

<p>The Kits for Cultural History are Fluxkits
for scholarly communication.</p>

<p>Fluxkits are "small boxes of
inexpensive materials assembled for personal use" made during the 1960s and
'70s by George Maciunas, Ay-O, George Brecht, Dick
Higgins, Alice Hutchins, Alison Knowles, Carla Liss, Larry
Miller, Nam June Paik, Mieko Shiomi, Yoshimasa Wada, Robert Watts, and other Fluxists
(Higgins 2002, 34). From a can of beans packed with facts about beans printed
on small scrolls fastened with elastic (Knowles 1965), to a nest of thirty-four
boxes cut and folded from only two sheets of paper (Shiomi
1965), to contiguous plastic compartments filled with light bulbs and candles
(Watts 1972), they are textures of everyday life. Maciunas
called them boxed anthologies. He curated, published, and mailed them as "Fluxus Editions," with the first one (1964-65) containing
contributions from thirty-nine artists. He branded them, too, designing over
sixty labels for various kits: Hutchins's <em>Jewelry Fluxkit</em>
(1968), Liss's <em>Sacrament Fluxkit</em>
(1969), and Wada's <em>Smoke Fluxkit</em> (1969), for
instance. Later, Knowles (2011) said Fluxkits
"contradict framed pieces on a wall."</p>

<p>Whatever the description, they are not precious. They are
multiples. Their parts can be replaced; they can also be
handled by audiences. One may even argue, as Hannah Higgins does, that Fluxkits do not merely represent sensation. They are
sensory experiences, blurring distinctions between object and event, material
and concept. Echoing Higgins, this blur renders "physical or actual experiences
central to the process of signification" (2002, 36). It also refuses the
hierarchy of primary and secondary knowledge—of mind and body (2002, 36).
Nudging thought through tactile media, Fluxkits
become art and amusement at once (Lushetich 2011,
24).</p>

<p>But the Kits for Cultural History are not art, nor do they
aim to be. Perhaps they are best understood as small boxes of inexpensive
materials assembled for media history. They become arguments and amusement at
once. As arguments, they contradict articles in a journal. They fabricate their
own evidence off the page for assembly. Or, in scholarly terms, they identify
gaps in material culture and prototype the absences for examination. Examples
include prototyping early wearable technologies—referred to as "electro-mobile
jewelry" during the Victorian period—inaccessible in today's memory
institutions.</p>

</figure>


<p>Here, "inaccessible" not only refers to the fact that no
Victorian electro-mobile jewelry exists in functioning form (Gere and Rudoe 2010, 213). It also accounts for extant instances of
the jewelry, none of which functions, is readily available for handling, or can
be fully digitized. Indeed, with early wearables,
there are many occlusions. Their interiors are obscured. Parts and wholes are
missing. Manufacturing conditions are mysterious. Use cultures are spectral.
Mechanisms are found only on paper.</p>

<p>These are absences common to the Kits, which identify what
we cannot experience or know for certain, to then prototype speculations about
the past. These speculations establish indexical relations with history. They
produce a tangible "that" for warranting and reference: tactile manifestations
of abductive reasoning and assumption (Peirce 1901,
1955). They are attempts to recover, repair, and re-contextualize the stuff of
history.</p>

<p>Even when held in hand, these prototypes are conceptual.
They are clearly not sourced from from another
century. They correspond with the past from the present: three-axis hypotheses
without much dust or age. Being prototypes, they are also frozen gestures. They
demand a supplement. They invite explanation or addition.</p>

<p>As amusement, the Kits are elliptical in their assertions
about culture and history. They divert and distract. They entertain
possibilities through procedures, with an honesty
about what they cannot prove, capture, or reproduce but are nevertheless
willing to conjecture (Kraus 2009, para. 4). They are
a touch anachronistic as well, employing today's gadgets to remake yesterday's
novelties (Sayers 2015). Examples include the use of computer-aided
manufacturing to fabricate components of those early wearables
mentioned moments ago. Assembling these components into a functioning prototype
becomes a line of inquiry: a series of choices for translating this into that.
Even as a process, this assembly is material. To ask "what if?" here and now
requires arrangement and memory. Decisions are made, and there is always a
setting, with participants and conditions. </p>

</figure>



<p>Perhaps most important, with the Kits amusement is not
necessarily synonymous with pleasure or play. To ask "what if?"&#8212;to entertain possibilities&#8212;does not imply blissful ignorance
of media history. With the Kits, the appeal of the inorganic (Benjamin 1927-40,
1999) prompts people to consider why what they may not know matters. For whom were early wearables
intended? How were they made? What was it like to wear electricity during the
1860s? Why is there so little documentation of these experiences? Why do no
early wearables exist in a functioning state today?
Did they ever function? What conclusions can be drawn in the face of such lack?
What, if anything, can be recovered or repaired? How are we complicit with the
history at hand? Even if answers to these questions are uncertain, the Kits
afford opportunities for unpacking an argument in between object and event,
material and concept, with an investment in doing media history through new
media (McPherson 2009, 120).</p>

<p>Below, then, are the key components of the Kits, inspired
such as they are by Fluxkits, toward making the
inaccessible matter.</p>

<h3>A Box</h3>

<p>As with any Fluxkit, the Kits are
arranged and distributed in tactile boxes, usually made of wood. The wood is
laser-cut, and the boxes often have drawers and compartments. Their design is intended to correspond, at least in part,
with their time period, their object of inquiry, or both. Thus a box for an
Early Wearable Kit may resemble a Victorian jewelry box, or its surface may be
engraved with the signature of the wearable's original designer.</p>

</figure>



<p>However, the boxes' relation to history is not mimetic. They
are not replicas or reproductions. They foreground how the past is interpreted
through present conditions, exhibiting history as a collection of refreshed
traces, with both loss and gain: a signature is cropped from a digital image of
an illustration dated 1863 and then fed through a laser cutter, which burns the
Victorian autograph onto birch. Remediation and change are fundamental to this
procedure and its transduction of history into Kit form (Bolter and Grusin 1999).</p>

</figure>



<p>The boxes also draw from the mechanical arts, or from the
intersection of function and aesthetics. They are practical. And they are not
at all. Resonating with a Fluxus absorption in the
everyday, their design is conducive to batch manufacturing. They are meant to
be multiples. Yet they structure content deliberately. Images frequently
ignored by media studies may be printed, rolled, fastened with elastic, and tucked
into a hidden compartment. Or a prototype's component parts may be placed on a
box's top tier, above the contextual materials stored in the bottom tier,
hinting at what is typically overlooked by historical accounts. As audiences
remove these materials and arrange them for interpretation, they may become
aware of how the box's design tacitly asserts itself.</p>

<p>Recalling Dick Higgins's notion of "intermedia,"
the unpacking process may spark questions such as, "‘what that I know does this
new work lie between?'" (2001, 53). Between container
and essay? Guide and argument? Box
and book? This between state destabilizes the default states of
materials in a given Kit, resisting the efficiency, optimization, and
comprehensiveness associated with modular, "kit-of-parts" construction, where
the parts are treated as discrete components of a coherent system with a
defined purpose that is often represented through a 3-D model (Perner-Wilson 2011, 6).</p>

<p>As arguments, the Kits declare the history at hand is
incomplete. Hidden compartments point to absences in the scholarly record,
implying more omissions exist somewhere beyond the container. A signature burnt
into a lid refreshes traces of its author, who is no longer with us. A
prototype arrives in multiple parts insinuating various versions. With the box,
there's a message: "This is not a replica." Again, the goal is not exact
reproduction (Elliott et al. 2012, 127). Material absences in archives and
collections are featured, and—as with Fluxkits—the
gaps can be left alone, interpreted, questioned, or repaired.</p>

<h3>A Prototype</h3>

<p>With the Kits, repair is intertwined with prototyping. Each
box includes a prototype in tactile form. Every prototype is provided in
duplicate: one version is assembled, and the other is not. This way, audiences
see and handle a prototype in distinct iterations, and they make decisions
related to assembly. Aside from materials such as wire and batteries, all
component parts are made specifically for the Kits using a blend of manual and
computer numerical control (CNC) tools. Popular materials for manufacturing
include acrylic, foam, wood, paper, and biodegradable thermoplastic. Often, a
Kit contains several prototypes of the same mechanism. For instance, one early
wearable piece may assume four different versions in a single Kit.</p>

<p>Versioning old media underscores how objects could have
manifested differently, in ways that frequently escape documentation, illustrations,
patents, reviews, and mass production. To variously articulate component parts
is to demonstrate how technologies are constructed, replete with editorial
decisions, and subject to change and alteration over time. Versioning also
emphasizes how objects are congealed processes: decisions that facilitate and
impede more decisions; labor conducive and resistant to more labor. </p>

<p>In the Kits, matter cannot be abstracted from situated
practice. Rehearsing the Fluxist critique of the
disembodied eye, hand, and ear, the prototypes assert the role embodiment plays
in interpretation. Returning for a moment to Hannah Higgins, the Fluxkits "[offer] a primary experience of matter as art" (2002,
37). Like other Fluxus work
(including Fluxfilms), Fluxkits
"locate the eye with the human body, with all its motility and sentience,"
while relying on neither "scopic unity" nor
"experiential chaos" (2002, 25). Similarly, the Kits distribute sensory
experiences across media and through design. Their components do not add up or
cohere, and the combined presence of assembled prototypes and contiguous parts
gestures at possible paths through the material.</p>

<p>Ideally, these gestures remind audiences they are embodied,
and that they make embodied decisions as they unpack and remember media
history. Such a reminder does more than lay bare the device. It encourages
participation or even intervention, which need not be framed romantically, as
some authentic or transcendent experience (2002, 58-59). Instead, prototyping
is simultaneously social and personal. As multiples anchored in everyday
materials, the Kits highlight shared experiences: common assumptions about, for
instance, what art, craft, jewelry, technologies, culture, and history should
do or signify. As boxed anthologies prompting assembly, they stress differences
across situations and settings. Interpretations of the prototypes will
inevitably vary. Approaches to assembly will never be uniform. Criticisms of
the Kits will emerge from an array of perspectives and pressure points.</p>

<p>The imbrication of social and personal experiences in the Kits'
design refuses to essentialize "the user." It also
recognizes that media history is not somehow outside power and ideology. After
all, material culture is fundamental to reproducing values and shaping
perception. Drawing but one example from an Early Wearable Kit, media scholars
must ask not only why and under what assumptions electro-mobile jewelry
appealed to different people but also how jewelry was interwoven—as instrument,
symbol, protocol, labor, and commodity—with norms during the 1860s. Attending
to these entanglements of politics with aesthetics renders any examination of
matter an event irreducible to either individual experience or finished
product. Put this way, the Kits are inspired by Laura Devendorf
and Daniela K. Rosner, who conclude
that "designs for ‘making' can address a much broader set of concerns
than what's made" (2015, 565). This broader set can include concerns about
objects as processes and social relations, and it can direct scholarly
attention to the role prototyping may play in repairing, recovering,
conjecturing, and interpreting media history as more than an object of inquiry:
as knowledge that is made and constantly remade.</p>

<h3>A Model</h3>

<p>Almost every tactile component in a Kit also exists as a 3-D
computer-aided design model (OBJ), a 3-D computer-aided manufacturing file
(STL), and toolpath instructions for machining
(G-code). Via GitHub, these files are circulated
online for discovery, downloading, forking, editing, and fabrication. This
approach across formats and media means the Kits can be delivered online as
well as by post. It also means a single component can be replaced and expressed
in a variety of materials, including wood, metal, acrylic, foam, plastic, and
paper. All files in a Kit carry a Creative Commons BY NC license. They can be
shared and adapted in any medium or format assuming attribution is given and
the adapted material is not used for commercial purposes.</p>

<p>Some of these models are born-digital. For instance, all
components of a box may be designed in Rhinoceros 3-D and then cut with a
laser. Other models are products of digitization. For example, parts of a
prototype may be carved from wood and then measured using a structured-light 3-D
scanner, which outputs an object file viewable on a computer screen.</p>

<p>But the movement between bits and atoms is the most
interesting aspect of modeling in the Kits. Digitized objects can be edited
prior to fabrication. Surfaces can be smoothed, resolutions degraded, forms
exploded, meshes decimated, and sizes altered, always with options to undo and
automate. Meanwhile, born-digital objects can be altered after fabrication, by
both hands and machines. They can be polished, stained, filed, filled, routed,
glued, and joined. These changes in the material properties of a Kit's
components correspond with how they are perceived on and off screen. With the
Kits, audiences can observe how objects shift between material states: from
wood on a table to a model on a screen to instructions for a machine to acrylic
in hand. Audiences can also note how certain states are conducive to particular
modes of perception. For instance, design software such as Rhinoceros 3-D
affords incredibly detailed views of objects that contain millions of polygons.
Zooming in to see objects with such detail is not unlike using a microscope.</p>

<p>With these views, people can discretely edit and
manipulate objects through techniques impossible to achieve by hand. However,
the modeling process cannot be flattened to what appears on screen. The tactile
existence of objects is essential to handling and assembling prototypes in a
Kit. It is difficult to know whether digital models fit together, or whether
they are resilient, unless they are fabricated. Indeed, there is often a
link—however reliable or socially constructed—between trust and tactility.</p>

<p>If Fluxkits complicate framed
pieces on a wall, then the Kits for Cultural History complicate framed objects
on a screen. Not only do they distribute their component parts through numerous
formats and channels: the post, the online repository, the box, the file. They also demonstrate why media history is never
purely digital, or never purely visual. It is multimodal and intermedial, an iterative process of this becoming that
(Fuller 2005, 85).</p>

<h3>A Supplement</h3>

<p>In the Kits, boxes, prototypes, and models are not
standalone objects. Even if they make arguments, they demand supplementation.
They are accompanied by images—printed but also published online—offering
historical context: illustrations, photographs, and figures from patents. These
images are additive; they give the inaccessible a sense of for whom, by whom,
and when.</p>

<p>Yet they are also explained, in part, by a
guide accompanying a Kit's components. Somewhere between a grangerized
book, a zine, and an academic essay, the guide is
glued and stitched together. For immediate discovery, it is usually placed
directly underneath the lid of a box. For circulation online, it is rendered
into a series of page images compiled in portable document format (PDF). The
content is handmade and xeroxed, with a collage
aesthetic. It is also punctuated with keyword entries (Williams 1976). In the
case of an Early Wearable Kit, these keywords include "mourning," "gender,"
"miniature," "class," "performance," and "electromagnets." With references
to primary and secondary source materials, each keyword situates early wearables in history and culture, detailing how they were
made, received, worn, exhibited, and articulated with social norms and cultural
protocols.</p>

<p>As with the balance of a Kit, the guide is purposefully
incomplete. It is not a total account. It is a series of stress points: ways of
variously perceiving and interpreting the prototypes at hand. </p>

<p>Following Celia Pearce (2006, 68), we might call the Kits acts
of accidental theory. Instead of starting with a program, supporting it, and
ultimately proving it, the Kits present a collection of positions and
components for material inquiry. Though conjectural, this presentation may
serve the purposes of repair and recovery, prompting attention to absence and
omission. In this sense, the Kits echo a Fluxist
performance score for conducting an ordinary event. They do what they can to
make the banal interesting to audiences, somewhere in the middle of
demystification and immersion. This echo reverberates through assembly
instructions nested inside a given guide to a Kit.</p>

<p>To be sure, instructions are a touchy topic in media
history. On the one hand, they risk determinism by telling audiences exactly,
step by step, how something should be made. They are against interpretation.
They are mechanisms for mansplaining. On the other
hand, they can reflexively communicate tacit knowledge to potentially
interested audiences, who have the agency to follow them completely, in part,
or not at all. Either way, they are value-laden, biased, and pedagogical. With
the Kits, instructions acknowledge this tension, questioning their own
authority while noting when and why they are speculating about history. They
stress multiple approaches to the same prototype together with the possible
effects of those approaches. But most important, they encourage conjecture and
process instead of proof and product. They run suspicion of the past through
trial-and-error testing. What if historical materials are embellished or
unreliable? What if this technology is actually a fiction? Was that mechanism
actually built this way? What happens if we try to repair what ostensibly
worked then, but no longer does now?</p>

<p>Collectively, the boxes, prototypes, models, and supplements
in the Kits are&#8212;following Karen Barad
(2007)&#8212;entanglements of discourse with materials, events with entities, concepts
with mechanisms. Instead of assuming that media history is over there, to be
discovered and dissected, they suggest it is constantly remade, with
similarities persisting and differences emerging along the way. Agencies of matter and meaning are
constituted at once, "made together" (2007, 168).</p>
